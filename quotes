immediately obsolete! (Tony Nugent)

The options are really excellent and very powerful. (Anish Maharaj)

the BEST EDITOR EVER (Stuart Woolford)

Hint:  "vim" is "vi improved" - much better! (Sven Guckes)

visual mode in vim is a very powerful thing! (Tony Nugent)

I strongly advise using vim--its infinite undo/redo saved me much grief.
(Terry Brown)
