EDITING LOCAL HTML FILES (WWW)

Vim has some features which can help simplify the creation and
maintenance of HTML files, provided that the files you are editing are
available on the local file system. The ]f and ^Wf commands can be
used to jump to the file whose name appears under the cursor, thus not
only checking that the link is valid (at least the file name part of
the URL) or providing a quick and easy way to edit many related HTML
pages at once.
